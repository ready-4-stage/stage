# Stage Common

## Overview

In this module you'll find all useful classes for *Stage*.

- `stage.common.model` Here is the data model. There is no business logic in
here. We're using Lombok to spice up our Java. All classes have a no-args
constructor and an all-args one.

## Usage

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupID>stage</groupID>
    <artifactId>stage-common</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```
